  <p style="font-size:18;"><b>Issue @ 1</b>
  This is the long-form story about US's controversial topic of Trump presidency done by Yoyo and Zinnia who 
  are currently studying overseas for a semester. We kept contacting despite the time zone difference and they 
  were responsive and willing to accept the correction I made. This story is a bit lengthy so I spent around two days 
  to fact-check, do research, and correct the mistakes. Please see attached screen shots showing our conversation.

<p style="font-size:18;"> <b>Issue @ 2</b>
  In issue 2, I was the editor of Einder and Michael Shum. I'd the difficulty in contacting them because both of them rarely 
  replied me throught whatsapps. Though I reached them and talked to them in person after the Wed morning class and set the deadlines
  together, they still failed to do so. I offered them the guidelines and helped them brainstorm the ideas; unfortuneately, 
  Michael still failed to hand in his story until now.</p> 
  <p style="font-size:18;"> The story about freemium pricing was reported by Einderdeep Singh. Please see attached pictures of 
  our conversation and click the links to see the original story filed by Einder and the story I edited. Reporting style is a bit 
  like academic so I asked him to change the angle or style. Still he didn't reply me.</p>

<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-offset-1" style="font-size:16px">
<p style="font-size:18;">This is Cantonese culture’s story reported by Kenji Chan. He is a capable and communicative reporter who is always willing 
  to seek the editor’s advice when dealing with the difficulties in reporting. But sadly, he claimed that he was too busy so 
  he handed in the story very late. I kept pushing him to hand in as soon as possible so that I could have time to edit his story
 and ask him to amend something if further reporting is needed. However, due to the time limit and overdue paper, he didn’t even have time to revise. </p>

  <p style="font-size:18;">This is SEN student’s story reported by Candice and Sharon. Due to this co-work, Choco and I are their editors who edited 
    their text story and video story and I’m mainly responsible for their text story. I’ve been keeping up with their progress 
    and giving regular comment on their story topic. They’ve got good interviewees but the choice of word they used was a bit 
    ambiguous and incorrect, such as the definition of ‘SEN’. Subsequently, they understood it and corrected. But this is the 
    second edited draft and the reporters haven’t amended yet before I submited this portfolio. </p>

<h3><em>A Member of Distribution Officers </em></h3>
<div class="container-fluid">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-offset-1">
<p style="font-size:14;">Sean and I are distribution officers this year and we are eager to see the new changes in TYR’s distribution efficiency.
   Based on my past experience, I understand it’s particularly hard to push the year-2 to wrap magazines and distribute them. 
   So to comfort them and make them feel good, Sean and I have been keeping them company to wrap the magazines and guide them 
   in details.</p>

<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-offset-1">
  <p style="font-size:14;">When they said they were busy with their works, Sean and I, of course, not only called others to help,
    but we also do the job ourselves. I even helped them apply for the cheque beforehand in case some of the reporters claimed that they are short of money.
    These are something the former distribution officers failed to do for us. However, we’re sorry that we only sent issue 5 out temporarily due to the
     incompletion of publication; however, we will be in hurry to start our engine again as long as the issues are ready. </p>
